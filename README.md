# WeDeploy Demo Guidelines

> [View the example template to see a sample README and LICENSE](./template/)

Always keep these key principles in mind when building a WeDeploy Demo:

1) Build the demo as simple and lightweight as possible while still demonstrating the example.
2) All instructions to get the demo working for the user should be included in the `README.md`. If your readme is getting to complex, you should consider creating a WeDeploy tutorial.
3) Write code that is clear to understand and well organized.
4) Don't assume the users of your demos will be WeDeploy experts.

In the end, this is how your demo repo should look?
