# WeDeploy Example Guidelines

> [View the example template to see a sample readme, license, and editorconfig.](./template/)

#### Always keep these key principles in mind when building a WeDeploy Example:

1) Build the example as simple and lightweight as possible while still demonstrating the example.
2) All instructions to get the example working for the user should be included in the `README.md`. If your readme is getting to complex, you should consider creating a WeDeploy tutorial.
3) Write code that is clear to understand and well organized.
4) Don't assume the users of your demos will be WeDeploy experts.

#### In the end, this is how your example repo should look:
