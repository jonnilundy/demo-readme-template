# WeDeploy Demo Contribution Guidelines

> [View the example demo to see a sample README](https://github.com/wedeploy/demo-contribution/tree/master/demo-example)

Always keep these key principles in mind when building a WeDeploy Demo:

1) Build the demo as simple and lightweight as possible while still demonstrating the example.
2) All instructions to get the demo working for the user should be included in the `README.md`.
3) Write code that is clear to understand and well organized.
4) Don't assume the users of your demos will be WeDeploy experts.

In the end, this is how your demo repo should look?
